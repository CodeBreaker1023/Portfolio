# My Portfolio Page 

This page is intended to give future customers, employers, partners, etc. the opportunity to get to know me and see my work.
It was made to be simple and easy to follow for less technical viewers. However, each project will include an little
synopsis of the languages, librabries, and tools used to complete it.
